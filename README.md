# CompilerMZ
A full custom compiler for the .mz(Mecugni Zanasi) language!

To compile the file the steps made by the compiler are:
- Tokenization   :   tranforms the chars present in the input file to tokens suck as EXIT token
- Parsing        :   transforms the token list into a tree TBC
- Generating ASM :   part where the proper assembly is written into an output file
  
Added tester.sh utility to go from a .mz file to an executable file through:
- Compiling
- Assembling
- Linking
